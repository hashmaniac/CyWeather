# Weather_Dashboard

## Description

The motivation for building this application was the desire to create an application that uses JavaScript and the [Open-Mateo third-party API](https://api.open-mateo.com/v1/forecast) in order to dynamically update HTML and CSS..

The reason for building this specific project was the need for an application that displays the weather outlook for selected location coordinates.

The Open-Mateo API was used for retrieving the current day's hourly temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and cloud cover from 6AM - 6PM.

Some challenges faced during ths project were ensuring the correct interpretation and implementation of the information received from the Open-Mateo API, and ensuring that the API calls worked in tandem with the rest of the application.
